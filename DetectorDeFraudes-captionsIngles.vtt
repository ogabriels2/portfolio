Integrated Project II

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:06.326
Method for Protecting Financial Apps Against Fraud

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:07.225
Course: Computer Engineering / IT

00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:08.537
Hello.

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:14.004
This is our Integrated Project II for the
Computer Engineering course at Univesp.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:20.120
Our project is called “Method for Protecting
Financial Applications Against Fraud.”

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.040
Our group is formed by Alessandra de Lima,
Éder Cardoso, Gilson Souza, Michele Silva,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.600
Thaylla Oliveira, Yasmin Narciso,
Diego, and myself, Gabriel Silva.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.520
We were also guided by
Professor Ronaldo Fernandes.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.200
This semester, our goal was to mature the solution,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.560
validate the prototype, and deepen our
research against a daily problem:

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.268
digital scams.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.040
To solve this, we used a user-centered
methodology: Design Thinking.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.640
And the first stage is Empathy.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.760
We needed to listen to the community
and understand the real pain point.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.800
The data from our research was alarming.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.269
As we see in this graph, 86.67%
of the elderly we interviewed

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:14.640
admitted they had already fallen for some type of scam.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.088
In another survey, more than 63% of respondents

00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:23.366
had never even heard the term
“Social Engineering.”

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:26.560
This led us to the Definition stage.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.191
The problem wasn’t only technical —
it was also the lack of digital literacy.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.085
So we defined clear goals
based on the feedback.

00:01:36.377 --> 00:01:41.840
The solution needed a simple diagnosis,
such as “Fraud” or “OK,”

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.000
clear language, and a flow
with the minimum data possible.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.320
In the Ideation stage, we brainstormed
flows and messages,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.576
prioritizing non-technical language.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.800
And then we moved into Prototyping.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.083
This was where we directly applied what
we learned in Univesp’s courses.

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:04.360
We used IoT Communication Protocols
to design the app’s API.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.440
Analytical Geometry and Linear Algebra
were the basis of our AI model,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.644
helping us turn words into vectors.

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:17.326
Digital Signal Processing gave us the method
to filter messages,

00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:19.040
removing noise.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.200
And most importantly: Mobile App Development
and HCI,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.974
which guided us to focus on usability
with a simple interface, free of jargon.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.524
With this knowledge,
we built a technical pipeline.

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:41.538
The AI receives data, cleans the message,
classifies the text, and as an extra layer,

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:45.941
checks suspicious links using the VirusTotal API.

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:49.120
Now Diego, one of our developers,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.887
will show how the tool
actually works in practice.

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:59.430
Hello everyone. My name is Diego, and I’m
part of the PI Project team.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.917
I’ll start up the application.

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:08.701
We use Docker Compose
to create an abstracted environment.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
It’s running. The trained models
are already inside.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.019
Now I just update the application.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.446
Great. Very simple interface.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:25.320
Here, in this larger box, the user
enters the received messages.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.579
And here, in the smaller field, they enter the URLs.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.464
From there, we simply
send the message to analyze.

00:03:37.137 --> 00:03:37.680
Very well.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.261
I will place the first message here
in the main field — it has no link.

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.102
I’ll analyze it.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:50.044
The system quickly —
since the models are pre-trained —

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:52.336
checked it and identified it as fraud.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.712
The user clicks once to go back
and returns to the initial interface.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:08.103
Now I’ll select another message,
send it again and do the same process.

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:14.675
In this message, the system identified that
it is not fraud. So it’s very simple,
and even the color changes.

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:21.880
We even thought about the color palette
so the user wouldn’t be confused.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.200
Even if the user has difficulty reading,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.632
they will still be able to easily identify
whether it is fraud or not.

00:04:34.387 --> 00:04:38.102
That is basically how
our application works.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.400
As we saw, the tool is simple,
but it wasn’t born ready.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.160
The final stage of Design Thinking
is Testing and Iteration.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.664
When we tested the prototype,
the feedback was straightforward.

00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:54.920
People told us that our
language was still too technical.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.520
And our methodological report was clear.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.840
The feedback guided us
to adjust the vocabulary

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.080
and create more direct messages
without technical jargon.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.120
And the impact of this change was immediate.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.324
The community’s response shifted from
“confusing” to “great, very useful, essential.”

00:05:15.324 --> 00:05:17.165
So the solution was validated.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.640
In the end, our Integrated Project delivers
much more than a simple application.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.360
It delivers autonomy.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.800
The Fraud Analyzer is a shield,
but also a school.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.773
It protects the user in dangerous moments
and teaches them to protect themselves in the future.

00:05:36.217 --> 00:05:41.779
It’s also important to highlight that the system
only processes the message entered by the user,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.753
without storing personal data,
ensuring safety and privacy.

00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:52.120
Our next step is to expand the database,
implement accessibility features,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.541
such as font size adjustments and
high-contrast mode to make the tool
usable by everyone.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.960
Thank you very much for your attention,
and I hope you enjoyed our project.
